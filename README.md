# npDash

## Usage
npDash.html and assembly.json need to be in the same directory to operate.

###Firefox
npDash can be run locally from Firefox.

###Chrome ( and other webkit browsers?)
Chrome disables loading of local files (assembly.json) for security reasons.
One option to get around this is to start chrome with the "--allow-file-access-from-files" flags but poses a security risk.
Another option is to host a local-server using node.js or python.
